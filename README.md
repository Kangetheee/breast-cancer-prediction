# Breast Cancer Predictor

![App Interface](path/to/your_image1.png)  
_Example of the main interface of the Breast Cancer Predictor._

## Overview

The **Breast Cancer Predictor** is a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist healthcare professionals and researchers in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer based on diagnostic measurements. This application utilizes logistic regression to classify cell nuclei as either benign or malignant, using features like cell radius, texture, perimeter, and more.

The app features a user-friendly interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), where users can input diagnostic measurements manually or visualize the input data. The app also displays a radar chart to show a comparison between mean, worst, and standard error values, making it easier to interpret results.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool is designed to assist in research and diagnosis but should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Adjust cell nuclei measurements via interactive sliders.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a trained logistic regression model to predict breast cancer diagnoses.
- **Visualizations:** Displays a radar chart to compare different features.
- **Prediction Output:** Provides the likelihood of the diagnosis being benign or malignant.
- **Model Explanation:** Uses logistic regression for transparent and interpretable predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (v3.x)
- **Streamlit** (for the user interface)
- **Scikit-learn** (for the machine learning model)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Plotly** (for interactive visualizations)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Breast Cancer Predictor on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-predictor.git
cd breast-cancer-predictor
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Ensure you have the breast cancer dataset (`data.csv`) in the `data/` directory. You can download it from sources like the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

### 4. Run the Application

Once all dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the web application, and you can interact with it in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8501`.

### 5. Prediction Output

Once you input the diagnostic data, the model will output:

- **Diagnosis (Benign/Malignant)**: Indicates whether the tumor is likely to be benign or malignant.
- **Probability**: Shows the likelihood of the tumor being benign or malignant.

## Customization

### Change Model or Parameters

If you wish to update the model or customize parameters:

1. Edit the `model.py` file where the logistic regression model is defined.
2. Update the features or parameters used for training the model in the `train_model.py` file.
3. Re-run the app to apply the changes.
